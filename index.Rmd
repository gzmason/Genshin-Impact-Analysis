# Introduction

Genshin Impact is an ARPG game developed and published by miHoYo. It is a Gacha game in which players spend in-game currency to receive random characters or weapons, like a loot-box mechanic. Since in-game currency is scarce, oftentimes players face the situation that they cannot draw all the characters or weapons from banners without spending their real-world money. Thus, making a wise decision on which character or weapon to draw is essential.
