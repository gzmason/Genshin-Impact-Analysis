It is a Gacha game in which players spend in-game currency to receive random characters or weapons, like a loot-box mechanic. Since in-game currency is scarce, oftentimes players face the situation that they cannot draw all the characters or weapons from banners without spending their real-world money, also known as micro-transaction. Thus, making a wise decision on which character to draw is essential. Now the question is: what metrics should we use to evaluate the worthiness of a character? We provide a brief introduction of background knowledge on the settings of the game below. Characters have two rankings, 4-star and 5-star. A 5-star character is more scarce thus much more difficult to pull than a 4-star one. By saying more difficult to pull, we mean a player has to invest more in-game currency to acquire a 5-star character. Currently, there are 6 elements in the game: Pyro, Geo, Cryo, Electro, Anemo, and Hydro. All of the characters in the game are assigned to one of the categories above. Although not specified in the game, we can also roughly categorize characters into 3 categories: damage dealer, healer, and support. A character has 4 attributes affecting his/her strength: character level, constellation level, weapon, and artifact sets. Among these attributes, the constellation level is more expensive to invest since it requires you to pull the same characters multiple times to increase it. In other words, you have to invest more precious in-game currency to level up the constellation whereas it is rather easy to level up the other three attributes. A character’s friendship level increases if the player uses that character more often in the more relaxing and easier mode of the game, but it has no impact on the strength level of that character. Abyss is the hardest end-game content in the game, yet grants a considerable amount of in-game currency. Each Abyss lasts for half-month. This project aims at providing evaluation insights and metrics based on battle data of Abyss. Whether a character plays an important role in helping gamer beat Abyss can be used as a standard for strength evaluation. We will first introduce the process of gathering data from Chinese fan-made database, and how we translate and transform data to its appropriate type for easier use afterwards. We then will demonstrate how to relate characters’ attributes, elements, and rankings into account when estimating a character’s overall contribution to the clearance of Abyss. We also provide an interactive component so that a user can move the mouse to explore the dot on the Abyss appearance rate vs. owning rate plot. In the conclusion part, we will briefly discuss the learning experience and how we can improve our current metrics. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Our data is collected from a Chinese fan-made database: abyss_data This database collect data by inviting players who cleared Abyss to enter their id in the game, and gather their battle stats from miHoYo’s official player community, HoYoLAB, as players can display their battle stats to public. Given the fact that it is a fan-made database, the data formats seem to be rather inconsistent. None the less, we discover 4 consecutive Abyss sessions that have consistent data format which we use as our primary data source. They are sept_late, oct_early, oct_late, and nov_early. Each of them of three major tables: battle_stats, character_artifact, and character_owning. battle_stats contain the main battle data for Abyss. As a background check, Abyss has 4 floors, 9 - 12. Each floor has 3 levels. Each level require 2 groups to clear it. Each group can have maximum of 4 characters. This table record for each player, what characters he/she used to clear every level in each floor of Abyss, and the number of tries involved. character_artifact records character artifact set for each character that a player owns. character_owning records level, constellation level, and friendship level for each character that a player owns. In addition to these raw data, we also need to have a reference table for our character metadata, such as ranking and element type, as another scope when analyzing our raw data. Also, since raw data comes from a Chinese database, we need to do the translation as well. Fortunately, we found another fan-made database that contains all the information we want: Honey Hunter We scrap from that website to do all the translation and extra metadata table. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Since the original table comes in with xlsx format and Chinese characters, we need to do the translation, mapping of characters to their metadata, and saving to a csv file for easier future use. We web scrape the translation table and metadata table in data_translation.R as reference data tables. We scrape the English version and Chinese version of character names, weapon names, and artifact names and combine them to a mapping table. We also scrape the ranking and element as the metadata table. Then, we go through each xlsx file in 4 folders. Since each xlsx file has several sheets given the fact that one sheet can only held 1048576 rows of data, we have to implement a function to cascade sheets to a single data frame and then apply the mapping functions. We then save the transformed data frame with metadata to csv file afterwards. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values It is observed that all of our data do not have missing values. plot_missing(oct_early_battle_stats, percent = TRUE) plot_missing(oct_early_character_artifact, percent = TRUE) plot_missing(oct_early_character_owning, percent = TRUE) "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results", " Chapter 5 Results The above Cleveland Dot Plot illustrates the percentage of appearance in the Abyss for each character. Also, the color illustrates how the rates change from Late September to Early November. From the plot, we can observe that popular characters such as Bennett, Xingqiu and Raiden Shogun (at the top of the plot) have been keeping high appearance rates, while characters like Aloy, Amber and Xinyan (at the bottom of the plot) are generally rare in the Abyss mode. The percentages for each character are unlikely to change by much from month to month, but there are some exceptions like Xiangling whose appearance percentages keep increasing from Late September to Early November. The above Cleveland Dot Plot illustrates the usage rate for all characters. The usage rate is defined as: \\(usage \\ rate = \\frac{number\\ of\\ players\\ using\\ this\\ character}{number\\ of\\ players\\ owning\\ this\\ character}\\) The usage rate metric differ from appearance rate metric as it takes players inventory into account. Due to the loot-box mechanism of the game, many players don’t have certain character, and that is not reflected on the appearance rate metric. By using usage rate, we debias the data in the way that even a character that fewer people own can have high usage rate. The most significant example is Kaedehara Kazuha. His appearance rate is only around 50%, possibly because he is a five-star character that not many people own, yet his usage rate is about an astounding 97%, indicating that people owning him would be almost certain to use him to clear Abyss. Therefore, by the definition of usage rate, we can conclude that higher usage rate means higher power level, as players would more likely to use these characters instead of those with lower usage rate. We can also observe that majority of characters have a steady usage rate that does not vary much from month to month, yet there are exceptions as well. Sangonomiya Kokomi seems to gain huge increase in usage rate from September late to November early, which usually indicates thatr players invent more advanced and efficient technique to use this character. In such case, drawing this character seems to be reasonable given his/her improvement in usage rate. This graph illustrates the average percentage of usage for all characters across 4 sessions of Abyss, with additional information provided on character’s metadata like ranking and element type. This is where things get a little bit interesting as we are now viewing from a different angle. The first thing to notice is that among characters with high average usage rate, the majority of them are 5-star characters, or ranking of 5. This however, reflects the worthiness of a few 4-star characters in that region, namely Bennett, Xingqiu, Xiangling, and Diona. These 4-star characters shine in the area of average usage rate &gt; 50%. Since 4-star characters require much less in-game currency to acquire, players should focus on getting these “cheap” 4-star characters as soon as possible. On the other hand, the majority of 4-star characters aggragate at very low usage region &lt;10%. The other insight derived from this graph is relation between element type and usage rate. The anemo and cyro elements seem to dominate the high usage rate region &gt; 75%. Electro characters generally have an extremely low usage rate with the exception of Raiden Shogun. Hydro characters, while they are not in the top region, are actually performing quite well in the middle region 25% &lt; usage rate &lt; 75%. Geo characters suffer from the same problem as elecetro ones, they generally have low usage rate with the exception of Zhongli. Pyro characters have the most number of 5-star, yet most of them have mediocre usage rate, which indicates that it may not worth to draw a 5-star pyro character. We can see from the density curve that majority of 4-star characters do not have high usage rate, while 5-star characters have a steady distribution. That actually gives a clear estimation of 4-star character worthiness: it is highly likely that a new 4-star character would not help player clear Abyss. For a 5-star character, however, things get complicated. The distribution is quite flat, meaning we have no idea whether next 5-star character worth drawin. This is a scatter plot of Percentage of Appearance versus Average Constellation of each character. Since Constellation costs resources, Average Constellation can indicate how many resources players spend on enhancing each character on average. We can observe that game characters are generally located at the four corners, which means that they can be divided into 4 categories. Bottom left corner are characters who players are not likely to spend resources in enhancing them and do not often appear in the Abyss. Bottom right corner are characters who players would generally spend resources in enhancing them but do not often use them in the Abyss. Top left corner are characters who many players use them in the Abyss without spending excessive resources on them (so they are “strong”). Top right corner are characters who appear frequently in the Abyss but players have spent many resources enhancing them. In this parallel coordinate plot on percentage of appearance in the Abyss, average constellation and average friendship, each character is represented by a line. There is a trend that characters with high percentage of appearance and low average constellation have high average friendship. This means that players generally like those characters (indicated by high friendship) who are strong enough to appear frequently in the Abyss without requiring too many resources (indicated by low constellation). This boxplot shows the distribution of character levels for each character. We can observe that more than 50% of players have levelled up characters like Zhongli, Xiao, Raiden Shogun and Kamisato Ayaka to the maximum level. Notice that those characters at the top are generally characters with high Abyss Appearance Rate as indicated by previous graphs. On the other hand, most players do not level up Lisa, Amber, Xinyan and Aloy very much. Notice that they are the ones who players are not likely to use in the Abyss. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component This is an interactive scatter plot on Percentage of Appearance in the Abyss versus Character Owning Rate. The definition of Percentage of Appearance is the same as in previous plots – number of Abyss challenges that players choose to use this character divided by total number of challenges players make. The definition of Character Owning Rate is how much percent of players own this character. Each point is one character. Points closer to the top are characters who appear more frequently in Abyss, and points closer to the right are characters who are owned by many players. By moving the mouse onto a point, the name of that character is shown. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion The project serves as a great opportunity for us to apply what we learned in data analysis and visualization to a topic of our interests, Genshin Impact. We mainly want to derive insights on how to evaluate a character strength based on battle data against hardest end-game content, the Abyss. There are few key takeaways: 4-star characters generally perform quite poor in terms of usage rate, which indicates that players owning these characters would probably not use them in clearing the Abyss. Nonetheless, there are a few exceptions that have extraordinarily high usage rate even than other 5-star characters, namely Bennett, Xingqiu, Xiangling, and Diona. It is recommended that players should try to acquire these characters. A few 5-star characters lie in the high usage rate region &gt; 75%. These characters should also be considered worth drawing. In terms of resource worthiness, Venti, Zhongli, Kamisato Ayaka, and Kaedehara Kazuha are among the characters list that does not require enriching, or additional constellation level to work. Hydro, anemo, and cyro overall have best usage rate performances. Electro and geo generally perform worst with few exceptions. Of course there are several limitations that worth mentioning. The data we collected span only 4 sessions of Abyss, which is quite few considering there are 2 sessions every month and Genshin Impact started last October. We cannot observe a good overall trend for character strength given so little data we use. Also, we focus a lot on appearance rate and usage rate to analyze our data, yet there should be other evaluation metrics that we can establish, and comparison between these metrics would be even more meaningful. There are several potential improvements that can be made in the future. First of all, we have not included data on equipments in this project yet. Equipments play important roles in characters’ strengths, and equipments themselves costs resources to purchase or enhance, just like characters. Therefore, by visualizing the correlation betweeen equipments and some of our indicators such as usage rate, players will have better understanding on which equipments they should enhance. In addition, in the Abyss, characters fight together in group of 4, and there are interactions among characters. For example, pyro and electro elements together will cause overload. While the current project analyzes each character individually, further work can be done on analyzing the combination of characters so that the interactions among characters can be considered.
